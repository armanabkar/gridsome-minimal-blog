A programmer reading books is an even rarer occurrence, most often relying on the internet search results to find answers.</p>\n<p>Technology is moving forward at a pace faster than anytime in the history of mankind. There are new programming languages and tools every few months, aspiring to be the silver bullet for all shortcoming of existing languages, tools and methodologies.</p>\n<p>The truth is that many a great minds of the yester years have already encountered the very same problems and have figured out the best ways to solve them. The tactics to approach and solve the problems have been captured in some wonderful books.</p>\n<p>Here's a select subset of these great books that developer in the industry should read.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-pragmatic-programmer\"><a href=\"#the-pragmatic-programmer\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>The Pragmatic Programmer</h2>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=020161622X&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=softwareyoga-20\" width=\"180px\" />\n  <br>\n</h2>\n<p>A gem of a book!

It depends on how solid of a foundation you want to have. If you want to have a really solid foundation, then the answer is a resounding “yes.”</p>\n<p>The book is challenging. It deals with functional programming. It was written for the famous introductory programming course at MIT. I’d recommend you not only <em>read</em> this book, but also go through all the exercises in it.

It’s not a particularly easy read, and the descriptions and examples might be a bit difficult to follow—especially if you don’t have a solid grasp of UML—but it’s a book I consider a “must read.” If you are having trouble with this book, you might want to start with “Head First Design Patterns,” which teaches the design patterns in this book in a much more digestible way—still, there is no substitute for the original.</p>\n<h2 id=\"compilers-principles-techniques-and-tools\"><a href=\"#compilers-principles-techniques-and-tools\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools</h2>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://simpleprogrammer.com/ezoimgfmt/spzone-simpleprogrammer.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-and-Tools.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:200x303/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1\" width=\"180px\" />\n  <br>\n</h2>\n<p>This book is known as the dragon book—and for good reason.</p>\n<p>It goes down deep into places where the dragons live: in the realm of compilers and operating systems.</p>\n<p>Some of the information might be a bit dated, but if you are really interested in how compilers work and perhaps want to write your own, take a crack at this book.</p>\n<h2 id=\"head-first-design-patterns\"><a href=\"#head-first-design-patterns\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Head First Design Patterns</h2>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0596007124&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=softwareyoga-20\" width=\"180px\" />\n  <br>\n</h2>\n<p>The most non-technical looking book on programming! Each page contains doodles, pictures and other eye-catching stuff.

It will help you create functional, elegant, reusable, and flexible software. The trade-off for each patterns have been clearly pointed out. Most books on design pattern talk about how to implement the pattern, but the authors of this book also explain the why and the how.</p>\n<p>The latest edition of the book now includes updates for Java 8 - mainly the Lambda.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introduction-to-algorithms-third-edition\"><a href=\"#introduction-to-algorithms-third-edition\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition</h2>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://simpleprogrammer.com/ezoimgfmt/spzone-simpleprogrammer.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Introduction-to-Algorithms-Third-Edition.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:200x276/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1\" width=\"180px\" />\n  <br>\n</h2>\n<p>This book is considered one of the best books on learning algorithms, and for good reason.

This is not a book about programming. This is a book about managing and motivating programmers. It should be read by developers too. Many a times, developers, especially inexperienced ones don't understand the thought process of management.</p>\n<p>Software development is a creative process. But most managers treat it as assembly line process. Developers are seen as interchangeable cogs in the machine. Managers generally see giving tight deadlines as the only way to increase motivation. They do not take interest in the work developers do and sadly, not try to understand the developers.</p>\n<p>If you are a manager who wants quality and not only quantity, read this book now!</p>\n<p>The authors explain how managers can enable their software teams to realize their potential in a sustainable manner.</p>\n<h2 id=\"domain-driven-design-tackling-complexity-in-the-heart-of-software\"><a href=\"#domain-driven-design-tackling-complexity-in-the-heart-of-software\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</h2>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://simpleprogrammer.com/ezoimgfmt/spzone-simpleprogrammer.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/domain-driven-design.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:200x265/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1\" width=\"180px\" />\n  <br>\n</h2>\n<p>Buckle your seat belt, this is a difficult read. The first time I read this book, I didn’t get it. The second time I read it, I sort of got it. It wasn’t until my third pass through the book that it finally clicked all the way. This book will help you learn how to create a maintainable architecture that is based on domain modeling. Once you learn what is in this book, you can’t go back.

But what makes this book different is that we approach these principles without drowning in all the heavy terminology. We look at a subset of FP foundational concepts that I call \"Functional-Light Programming\" (FLP) and apply it to JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Note: Despite the word \"Light\" in the title, I do not consider or recommend this book as a \"beginner\", \"easy\", or \"intro\" book on the topic. This book is rigorous and full of gritty detail; it expects a solid foundation of JS knowledge before diving in. \"Light\" means limited in scope; instead of being more broad, this book goes much deeper into each topic than you typically find in other FP-JavaScript books.</p>\n<p>Let's face it: unless you're already a member of the FP cool kids club (I'm not!), a statement like, \"a monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors\", just doesn't mean anything useful to us.</p>\n<p>That's not to say the terms are meaningless or that FPrs are bad for using them. Once you graduate from Functional-Light, you'll maybe/hopefully want to study FP more formally, and you'll certainly have plenty of exposure to what they mean and why.</p>\n<p>But I want you to be able to apply some of the fundamentals of FP to your JavaScript now, because I believe it will help you write better, more reasonable code.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>by Kyle Simpson</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Check out Functional-Light JavaScript on GitHub.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"you-dont-know-js\"><a href=\"#you-dont-know-js\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>You Don’t Know JS</h2>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://coder-coder.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/you-dont-know-js-kyle-simpson.png\" width=\"180px\" />\n  <br>\n</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of JavaScript books out there, and a lot of them are really big.

It all came from this book!</p>\n<p>\"All programmers are optimists: All will go well.\"</p>\n<p>\"Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.\"</p>\n<p>\"Bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned.\"</p>\n<p>\"An omelette, promised in two minutes, when not ready in two minutes, the customer has two choices - wait or eat it half-cooked. Software customers also have the same choices.\"</p>\n<p>It is unfortunate that we are making the same mistakes in software development year after year. A must read for every project manager and developer.</p>\n<p>As the title says, it is a collection of essays. A damn good one at that. The only downside of the book is the references to 25-year-old technologies. But that takes nothing away from the meat of the book.</p>\n<h2 id=\"soft-skills-the-software-developers-life-manual\"><a href=\"#soft-skills-the-software-developers-life-manual\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Soft Skills: The Software Developer's Life Manual</h2>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1617292397&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=softwareyoga-20\" width=\"180px\" />\n  <br>\n</h2>\n<p>Again, this is not a book about programming. But every programmer should read this.</p>\n<p>A great book on managing \"other\" aspects of developers life. It's about everything there could be in your life - It’s about your career, life, body, mind, and believe it or not - soul as well.</p>\n<p>The author himself has followed these techniques and is quite successful at that. His website says that he was able to quit his day job in his early 30's. The author has culminated his life's experiences in neatly divided short chapters on Career, Marketing yourself, Learning, Productivity, Finances, Fitness and Spirit. Each chapter is short enough to be read on a coffee break, that makes it a fairly light read.</p>\n<p>You will be a much more satisfied and happier person if you follow the suggestions in this book, not just as a programmer, but as your whole self.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-passionate-programmer-creating-a-remarkable-career-in-software-development\"><a href=\"#the-passionate-programmer-creating-a-remarkable-career-in-software-development\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>The Passionate Programmer: Creating a Remarkable Career in Software Development</h2>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://simpleprogrammer.com/ezoimgfmt/spzone-simpleprogrammer.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Passionate-Programmer.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:200x300/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1\" width=\"180px\" />\n  <br>\n</h2>\n<p>This book was one of the main programming books that influenced me to treat my career in software development as a business rather than just something I did. The book is full of all kinds of wisdom about how to increase your skills, maximize your time, keep your career and passion alive, and more. I highly recommend reading this book if you want to move beyond programming as just a job.</p>\n<h2 id=\"code-the-hidden-language-of-computer-hardware-and-software-developer-best-practices\"><a href=\"#code-the-hidden-language-of-computer-hardware-and-software-developer-best-practices\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software (Developer Best Practices)</h2>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://simpleprogrammer.com/ezoimgfmt/spzone-simpleprogrammer.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Code-The-Hidden-Language-of-Computer-Hardware-and-Software-Developer-Best-Practices.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:200x298/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1\" width=\"180px\" />\n  <br>\n</h2>\n<p>This is a fascinating book. Again, it’s not explicitly a programming book, but it is all about how computers work at the very lowest level. After reading this book you'll understand what the code you are writing is actually doing and how a CPU actually executes your code. This is both a fun and fascinating read.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people\"><a href=\"#how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>How to Win Friends and Influence People</h2>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://simpleprogrammer.com/ezoimgfmt/spzone-simpleprogrammer.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/How-To-Win-Friends-and-Influence-People.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:200x309/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1\" width=\"180px\" />\n  <br>\n</h2>\n<p>I really can’t praise this book enough. Yes, it has nothing to do with programming. You might be surprised to find this on a programming books list, but this is a life-changing book. As a software developer, you will deal with people during your entire career. If you learn how to deal with them effectively, you’ll have a much better go of it. So, I highly recommend reading this book. This book changed my life and set me on the path I am on now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"deep-work\"><a href=\"#deep-work\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Deep Work</h2>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://coder-coder.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cal-newport-deep-work.jpg\" width=\"180px\" />\n  <br>\n</h2>\n<p>This book has truly changed the way that I approach work. While most people lead extremely busy lives and constantly try to do and achieve more, Newport has taken the complete opposite approach of “less is more.”</p>\n<p>As the topic of the book implies, he talks a lot about how he personally has developed a practice of ultra-focused deep work over the years (and his accomplishments are quite impressive). Newport also advocates for cutting out elements from your life that don’t lead you toward your most important goals.</p>\n<p>This book is applicable to web developers and anyone whose work would benefit from long stretches of complete mental focus. I highly, highly recommend it to anyone to read, in any field.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-power-of-habit\"><a href=\"#the-power-of-habit\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>The Power of Habit</h2>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://coder-coder.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/charles-duhigg-power-of-habit.jpg\" width=\"180px\" />\n  <br>\n</h2>\n<p>The Power of Habit is another book that can be applied to working more efficiently and honestly improving your life habits. Duhigg writes eloquently about how habits (both good and bad) are formed and broken, often without our realization.</p>\n<p>He uses real world, scientific examples to illustrate these concepts in a very persuasive approach. If you’re interested in stopping bad habits, picking up good ones, and increasing your willpower (which he argues can be developed like any other skill!) then you’ll likely benefit from this book.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-complete-software-developers-career-guide\"><a href=\"#the-complete-software-developers-career-guide\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>The Complete Software Developer’s Career Guide</h2>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://simpleprogrammer.com/ezoimgfmt/spzone-simpleprogrammer.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/careerguide-amazon.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:200x298/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1\" width=\"180px\" />\n  <br>\n</h2>\n<p>I wrote this book primarily because there just wasn’t a good book out there—or really any book for that matter—that told software developers everything they needed to know about how to have a successful career in software development and to answer all the common questions I get like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do I get started as a software developer?</li>\n<li>How do I learn a new programming language?</li>\n<li>College, boot camp, self study?</li>\n<li>How do I deal with my asshole boss?
